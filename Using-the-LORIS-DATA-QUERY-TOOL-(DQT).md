This documentation provides a brief overview on how to perform the data selection (image data and behavioural data) of the COVID-19 datasets in the UK Biobank and itâ€™s visibility into NeuroHub. 

###  Context
[ukb-covid.loris.ca](https://ukb-covid.loris.ca/) holds a reduced set of data for the UKBiobank participants having COVID19 records. From the Data Query Tool **(DQT)** module, you will be able to query that dataset for any variable (fields) along with T1w provided in our ukbb application. 
Clicking the Export to NeuroHub button, all selected fields will be saved in a _csv_ file in your _NeuroHub_ project. If the selected fields contain images files, a special file (_CBRAIN File List_) will be created. This special file will allow users to use the copy of the file that resides on Compute Canada without avoiding the creation of a copy of all those image files.

### Prerequisite
You need an approved UKBiobank account before requesting a LORIs account (details on the application process can be found [here](). After having filled the request account form for UKBiobank data access, you should have received an email from _no-reply@ukb-covid.loris.ca_ containing a password to access a LORIS instance.

### Step by step
- go to [https://ukb-covid.loris.ca/](https://ukb-covid.loris.ca) 
- login using your email address and the password from the email. 
  - If it is the first time you login, you will be prompted to enter a new password
