The NeuroHub [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) is providing with an interactive computational component to the platform, giving access to data stored on NeuroHub. To show how this work a few notebooks  

Jupyter notebook examples are being developed at [neurohub/neurohub_examples](https://github.com/neurohub/neurohub_examples).

So far there is a basic example of how to access NeuroHub using the [CBRAIN API](https://portal.cbrain.mcgill.ca/swagger#/).  Neuroimaging and ML examples are to come. While you can use the NeuroHub JupyterHub for any interactive computing, the use of the current notebook examples requires some coding expertise and understanding of application program interface.
